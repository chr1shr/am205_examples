Harvard Applied Math 205: Code Examples
Unit 4: Nonlinear Equations and Optimization
============================================
bisection.py - Demonstrates the one-dimensional bisection root-finding
algorithm.

iter.py - Demonstrates two possible fixed-point iterations for finding the
solution to a nonlinear equation. One converges to the solution, whereas the
other diverges.

iter_2d.py - Demonstrates a fixed-point iteration to find the solution of a
two-dimensional nonlinear function.

fsolve.py - Demonstrates Python's "fsolve" routine for finding the nodes and
weights in the two-point Gauss quadrature scheme.

nr_secant.py - Uses the Newton-Raphson and secant methods to find the solution
to a nonlinear equation.

h_newton.py - Finds critical points of the Himmelblau function using the
Newton method.

h_bfgs.py - Finds minima of the Himmelblau function using the BFGS
optimization method.

linprog.py - this Python program solves the linear program described in the
slides. It makes use of the Python module cvxopt that is available online.

linprog_alt.py - this is an alternative Python program that solves the same
linear program, but with the linprog library in SciPy.
